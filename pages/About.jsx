      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Michael Reisch. I am a full-stack React developer and a
        recent graduate of Dev Academy Aotearoa. I have experience working
        effectively in teams and building functional web-applications. I have a
        passion for learning and utlilizing my creativity to solve real-world
        problems. I have an interest in learning Three.js and exploring data
        analysis with Python.
      </p>

        In my previous career I worked as a leading internationally-certified
        arborist for over a decade. I hope to bring my experience of working in
        tight-knit teams to the tech industry and fulfill my potential.

        In my free time I write songs on piano and guitar, play these songs in a
        band, ride my e-bike around Wellington, New Zealand and enjoy rock
        climbing.
