        For the last eleven years, across two countries, I worked as an
        internationally certified arborist. I climbed trees with chainsaws and
        cared for the urban forest. I led and developed effective teams as we
        worked collaboratively to solve complex and hazardous problems. But I
        always dreamt of working with technology.
