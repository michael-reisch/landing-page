        Intrigued by the fertile soil of combining creativity with logic to
        build useful applications and solve real-world problems, I enjoyed
        periods of self-study. Finally, after acquiring Residency in New Zealand
        I was granted the opportunity to participate in Dev Academy Aotearoa and
        fully commit to changing careers. <br />
